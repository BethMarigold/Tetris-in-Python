All of this code is from Programming With Nick's video for Tetris. There are some differences that I added though
I added a Hard Drop and Hold Block feature
WASD and Arrow Keys are used for movement. Hard Drop is Space. C is to Hold a block
After 10 lines cleared, the pieces fall down faster (the game update is 50ms less then it was before)
All credit goes to Programming With Nick for the game itself
