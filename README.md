All of this code is from Programming With Nick's video for Tetris. There are some differences that I added though
WASD and Arrow Keys are used for movement
There is now a Hard Drop, so whenever you press space, the piece goes down instantly
After 10 lines cleared, the pieces fall down faster (the game update is 50ms less then it was before)
All credit goes to Programming With Nick for the game itself
